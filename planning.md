AI Interviewer Platform: Comprehensive Plan

1. Project Overview
   The objective is to create a sophisticated, API-based platform that leverages a multi-agent AI system to conduct a voice-based interview with a subject, and then automatically generate a polished, publishable article from the conversation. The system is designed for modularity and high-quality output through an iterative refinement process.

2. Architectural Philosophy: Supervisor-Reflection Model
   The system's architecture is built on a multi-agent model to separate concerns and ensure each component is specialized for its task.

Agent Roles:

Interviewer Agent: The conversational front-end. Its role is to engage the user, ask a series of base questions, and generate dynamic, context-aware follow-up questions. Its final output is a clean, structured transcript with speaker diarization.
Writer Agent: The creative engine. It takes the interview transcript and a target audience profile as input and synthesizes them into a coherent, well-structured article draft.
Editor Agent: The quality control mechanism. It reviews the article draft against a set of criteria (e.g., clarity, tone, factual consistency) and generates structured, actionable feedback.
Core Workflow: The Reflection Loop
The interaction between the Writer and Editor agents implements a reflection pattern. This is not a simple linear handoff, but a cycle:

The Writer produces a draft.
The Editor critiques the draft.
If critiques exist, the feedback is sent back to the Writer, which generates a new, improved version.
This loop continues until the Editor approves the article, at which point the workflow concludes. This iterative process is key to achieving a high-quality final product.   3. Simplified Technology Stack
To accelerate development and reduce complexity, we will use a lean, powerful, and highly synergistic technology stack.

Agent Framework: Pydantic AI

Justification: Pydantic AI provides a unified solution for both agent definition and orchestration. It leverages Python's native feel and Pydantic's robust data validation to create reliable, "type-safe" agents. Its built-in graph support is capable of managing the required cyclical workflow between the Writer and Editor, offering a simpler alternative to more complex frameworks.

Voice Services (STT & TTS): ElevenLabs

Justification: Consolidating on a single provider simplifies integration. ElevenLabs is the market leader in high-quality, natural-sounding Text-to-Speech (TTS), which is essential for a pleasant user experience. Their Speech-to-Text (STT) model, Scribe, is highly accurate and supports speaker diarization, a critical feature for transcribing a two-party interview.

Python Quickstart: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/cookbooks/speech-to-text/quickstart
API Backend: FastAPI

Justification: FastAPI is a high-performance, asynchronous web framework. Its native integration with Pydantic makes it the perfect choice for serving our Pydantic AI agents, ensuring seamless data validation from the API endpoint all the way through the agent workflow. Its async nature is critical for handling real-time voice streams without blocking.

Background Jobs: FastAPI BackgroundTasks

Justification: The full interview-to-article process can be long-running. Instead of implementing a complex task queue like Celery/Redis, we will start with FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks. This allows the API to immediately return a response to the client while the agent workflow runs in the background, providing a simpler solution for initial development.

Database: SQLite

Justification: For persisting agent state, transcripts, and articles, a full-fledged PostgreSQL server is overkill initially. Python's built-in sqlite3 module provides a simple, serverless, file-based database that is more than sufficient for development and many production use cases, drastically simplifying setup and deployment.
Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html 4. Data Flow and State Management
Central State: The entire workflow will be managed via a central state object, defined as a Pydantic model. This object will contain all artifacts of the process, including the initial prompt, the full interview transcript, all article drafts, and all editor feedback.
Data Schemas: Pydantic will be used to define strict schemas for all data structures. This is non-negotiable. It ensures data integrity and allows Pydantic AI to automatically validate agent outputs, retry on failure, and enforce reliable communication between agents.
InterviewTranscript: Will contain a list of messages with speaker labels and timestamps.
ArticleDraft: Will contain the article title, content, and version number.
EditorFeedback: Will contain a list of specific critiques and a boolean is_approved flag to control the reflection loop. 5. Phased Development Plan
The project will be built incrementally to manage complexity.

Phase 1: Core Agent Logic (Text-Only): Build and test the multi-agent workflow using text inputs and outputs. The main goal is to perfect the reflection loop between the Writer and Editor.
Phase 2: API Backend & Persistence: Wrap the agent logic in a FastAPI application. Implement the BackgroundTasks and SQLite persistence layer.
Phase 3: Voice Integration: Integrate ElevenLabs STT and TTS services. Build the real-time voice communication layer using WebSockets in FastAPI.
Phase 4: Deployment & Front-End: Containerize the application with Docker and prepare for deployment. Develop a simple front-end for interaction.
